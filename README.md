## Image Refs
Testing what type of image references GitHub supports

We know that relative from root works:


![image 1](images/img1/image1.png)


![image 2](images/img2/image2.png)

How do relative images behave from deeper?

[markdown](dir1/dir2/dir3/test.md)

[asciidoc](dir1/dir2/dir3/test.adoc)

## Quoted text

If we use markdown style quoted text, how does that appear on GitHub?

> Quoted text.
>
> Another paragraph in quote.
