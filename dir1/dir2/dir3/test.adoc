Does asciidoctor support the same realtive images links?

Yes, it seems we can use root relative syntax:

image:/images/img1/image1.png[image 1]
image:/images/img2/image2.png[image 2]

Does relative syntax also work? Yes it does.

image:../../../images/img1/image1.png[image 1]
image:../../../images/img2/image2.png[image 2]
