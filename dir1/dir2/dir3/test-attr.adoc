:imagesdir: /images/img1

Asciidoctor also supports specifying the image dir, does GitHub have an understanding of that?

image:image1.png[image 1]

Ya it does, in tests the following worked:

```
:imagesdir: ../../images/img1
```
which is confusing... because I am 3 not 2 dirs down.

Root relative where root is repo root works:
```
:imagesdir: /images/img1
```
